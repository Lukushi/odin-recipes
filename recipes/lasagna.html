        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>

        <li>1 cup beef or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Olive oil for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the cheese mixture:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>15 oz (425g) ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles (oven-ready or cooked according to package instructions)</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Additional grated Parmesan cheese for topping</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat a drizzle of olive oil over medium heat. 
            Add the chopped onion and garlic, and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add the ground beef or Italian sausage to the skillet and cook until browned, 
            breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, beef or vegetable broth, dried basil, and dried oregano. 
            Season with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer the sauce for about 10-15 minutes, 
            until it thickens slightly. Remove from heat and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, grated Parmesan cheese, 
            chopped parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. 
            Place a layer of lasagna noodles on top, followed by a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture and a layer 
            of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, 
            ending with a layer of meat sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and sprinkle additional grated Parmesan cheese on top of the lasagna. 
            Return it to the oven and bake, uncovered, for an additional 10-15 minutes, 
            or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before slicing and serving. 
            Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
