    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There are smoothies, and then there are high-protein smoothies. 
        Both are easy to make and refreshing to drink, but smoothies that are higher in protein 
        can be quick and easy meals all by themselves. The protein helps to rebuild and repair 
        muscles after a tough workout; and it makes you feel fuller, longer, helping to curb the need 
        to reach for a snack between meals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Packed with nutrients, homemade high-protein smoothies are also super easy to create. 
        All you need are a few key ingredients, a blender, and a little imagination. 
        If you're cutting out dairy, I'll show you how to easily make them vegan by substituting 
        non-dairy milk, yogurt, and other ingredients in your favorite smoothie recipes. 
        Follow these tips to make the most of your meal in a glass with a "Tropical Paradise" smoothie.        
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ripe banana</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pineapple chunks (fresh or frozen)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mango chunks (fresh or frozen)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup coconut milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Greek yogurt (plain or vanilla flavored)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey (optional, for added sweetness)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ice cubes (optional, for a colder smoothie)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the banana and cut it into chunks.</li>
        <li>If using fresh fruit, peel and dice the pineapple and mango.</li>
        <li>In a blender, combine the banana, pineapple chunks, mango chunks, 
            coconut milk, Greek yogurt, and honey (if using).</li>
        <li>If you want a colder smoothie, add the ice cubes.</li>
        <li>Blend all the ingredients until smooth and creamy. 
            If the consistency is too thick, you can add more coconut milk or water to reach your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Pour the smoothie into a glass and serve immediately.</li>
        <li>Optionally, you can garnish with a slice of pineapple or a sprinkle of shredded 
            coconut for an extra tropical touch.</li>
    </ol>
