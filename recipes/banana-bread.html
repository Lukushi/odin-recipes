    <p>This banana bread recipe creates the most delicious, moist loaf with loads of banana flavor.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (75g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (50g) packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (190g) all-purpose flour</li>        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until smooth.</li>
        <li>In a separate large bowl, mix together the melted butter and both granulated and brown sugars until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add the beaten egg and vanilla extract to the butter and sugar mixture, stirring until smooth.</li>
        <li>Stir in the mashed bananas until evenly incorporated.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the baking soda and salt over the banana mixture, and mix well.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the flour to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. 
            Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are okay.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan, spreading it evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 50 to 60 minutes, 
            or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the banana bread from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once cooled slightly, transfer the banana bread to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve your delicious homemade banana bread, and enjoy it warm or at room temperature!</li>
    </ol>
